# 📁 Machine Learning (ML + DL + Projects)

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository!  
This folder is structured to help learn and revise key **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** concepts with solid theory, clean implementation, and practical projects — all aimed toward **placement preparation over the next 3 months** 🚀.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repo contains **Google Colab notebooks** organized by topics, including both **theory** and **hands-on implementation** using **small, real-world datasets**.

### 📊 Core Libraries:
- **NumPy** – Arrays, broadcasting, math operations
- **Pandas** – DataFrames, data cleaning, aggregation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization, plotting styles
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualizations
- **Apache Spark & PySpark** – Big Data handling and distributed processing

---

## 📘 Theory + Implementation

Each notebook is designed to include:
- ✍️ Concepts with notes and explanations
- 🧪 Code examples using real data

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning + Deep Learning

The repo also includes:
- 📌 Supervised & Unsupervised ML Algorithms
- 🧠 Deep Learning basics using TensorFlow/Keras
- 🛠️ Feature Engineering Techniques
- 🔍 Model Evaluation Metrics
- 🔄 Train-test splits, cross-validation, pipelines

---

## 💼 Projects

I'll be building **mini to major projects** that use the above tools and concepts, such as:
- 📈 Regression & Classification models
- 🧹 Data cleaning and visualization dashboards
- 🔎 ML pipelines with feature engineering
- 🤖 Basic Neural Networks
- ⚙️ Scalable processing with PySpark

---

## 🎯 Goal

> To revise and master core concepts in ML, DL, and data handling from **basics to advanced**, supported by practical applications — all geared toward cracking placements and SDE/Data roles.

---

## 📅 Timeline

🕒 **April – June 2025**: Focused, structured learning  
💪 Consistent updates as I progress
