# Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

In machine learning, the system learns from patterns in data, improves its performance over time, and can generalize from the experiences (data) to make predictions or perform tasks on new, unseen data. The process typically involves three key stages:

1. **Training**: The algorithm is fed a large dataset, where it learns the underlying patterns, relationships, or structures in the data.
2. **Testing**: After training, the model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance and how well it generalizes.
3. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and tested, it can be used to make predictions or decisions based on new input data.

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be categorized into several types, including:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the desired output is already known. The goal is to learn the mapping from input to output (e.g., classification or regression).
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm works with unlabeled data and tries to identify patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering or dimensionality reduction).
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through trial and error, receiving feedback from its actions (rewards or penalties) in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning is widely used in applications like:
- Image and speech recognition
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Fraud detection
- Natural language processing
